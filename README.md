# F.A.S.T.
### Fire and Air Support Tracker

FAST is a single page dynamic web application built on top of the Google Maps API. It provides a simple and intuitive tactical map for the user
to deliver military operational targeting data. The application is written almost entirely in Vanilla JS, but also includes some fetch, and the Open-Elevation API. FAST was
a Solo project I developed in a 1-week sprint.

It's primary features are displaying mapping coordinates in MGRS (Military Grid Reference System) rather than latitude and longitude. However it also displays a target's elevation, distance, direction, and even warns if the target is within a danger close radius.
